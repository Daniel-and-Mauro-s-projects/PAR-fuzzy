# PAR-fuzzy
A laboratory exercise on fuzzy expert systems for the Planning and Approximate class for the Master of Artificial Intelligence at UPC. 

# Task 1
Choose 5: 
- Abnormal subdomains: Phishing URLs may use the following pattern ‘w[w]?[0-9]*’ instead of
‘www’ to deceive users. Thus, URLs with subdomains matching such
pattern are considered phishing.

Ideas to select the 4 websites to test on: 
- for Phising websites: Phishtank, Openphish
- use subdomains, not just the main one, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel can be used as a legitimate URL instead of https://www.wikipedia.org.
